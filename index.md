# Solving PDEs in parallel on GPUs with Julia

\tableofcontents <!-- you can use \toc as well -->

This section is meant as a refresher if you're new to Franklin.
Have a look at both how the website renders and the corresponding markdown (`index.md`).
Modify at will to get a feeling for how things work!

Ps: if you want to modify the header or footer or the general look of the website, adjust the files in
* `src/_css/` and
* `src/_html_parts/`.

## The base with Markdown

The [standard markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) can be used such as titles using `#`, lists:

* element with **bold**
* element with _emph_

or code-blocks `inline` or with highlighting (note the `@def hascode = true` in the source to allow [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) to do its job):

```julia
abstract type Point end
struct PointR2{T<:Real} <: Point
    x::T
    y::T
end
struct PointR3{T<:Real} <: Point
    x::T
    y::T
    z::T
end
function len(p::T) where T<:Point
  sqrt(sum(getfield(p, η)^2 for η ∈ fieldnames(T)))
end
```

You can also quote stuff

> You must have chaos within you to ...

or have tables:

| English         | Mandarin   |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| winnie the pooh | 维尼熊      |

Note that you may have to do a bit of CSS-styling to get these elements to look the way you want them (the same holds for the whole page in fact).
