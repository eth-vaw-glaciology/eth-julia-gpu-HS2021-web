## Live evaluation of code blocks

If you would like to show code as well as what the code outputs, you only need to specify where the script corresponding to the code block will be saved.

Indeed, what happens is that the code block gets saved as a script which then gets executed.
This also allows for that block to not be re-executed every time you change something _else_ on the page.

Here's a simple example (change values in `a` to see the results being live updated):

```julia:./exdot.jl
using LinearAlgebra
a = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2]
@show dot(a, a)
println(dot(a, a))
```

You can now show what this would look like:

\output{./exdot.jl}
